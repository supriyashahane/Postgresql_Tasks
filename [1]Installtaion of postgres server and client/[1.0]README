INSTALLTAION OF PPOSTGRESQL SERVER AND CLIENT

[1] Download Source Code
https://www.postgresql.org/ftp/source/

[2] run configure
1st we have to install libreadline for successfull configure  
$ ./configure

[3] Complie
$ make

[4] Install 
$ sudo make install

[5] run initdb
$ mkdir /usr/local/pgsql/data
$ sudo adduser postgresql
$ sudo chown postgres:postgersql /usr/local/pgsql/data //add postgresql usr in /etc/sudors "%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL and postgres ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL"
$ sudo -i -u postgres
/usr/local/pgsql/bin/initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data

[6] set the superuser password using initdb
postgres@PUCSD:~$  sudo -i -u postgres /usr/local/pgsql/bin/createuser supriya --superuser
postgres@PUCSD:~$  createdb supriya
postgres@PUCSD:~$  createdb supriya
$ sudo -i -u supri
supriya@PUCSD:~$ psql

[7] set the server incoding during initdb
supriya@PUCSD:~$sudo -i -u postgres /usr/local/pgsql/bin/initdb en_IN -D /home/supriya/spc/data

[8] Start postgres/postmaster service
supriya@PUCSD:~$/usr/local/pgsql/bin/pg_ctl -D /usr/local/pgsql/data -l logfile start

[9] use pg_controldata to see the current server settings
postgres@PUCSD:/home/supriya/spc/data$ pg_controldata -V

[10] create serveral databases
postgres@PUCSD:~ /usr/local/pgsql/bin/createdb test
postgres@PUCSD:~ createdb supriya
supriya@PUCSD:~/spc$ createdb user1

[11] setup postmaster automatically on reboot and test
i made an .bashrc file in postgres by exporting pgsql/bin directory path to execute command 
postgres@PUCSD:~ echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/pgsql/bin/'>> ~/.bashrc
also create a  file to get pgsql recoginzed by user
supriya@PUCSD:~echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/pgsql/bin/'>> ~/.zshrc
every time on reboot postgresl ask for socket connect which will be started by intialisng/source /etc/rc.local file by  the command
supriya@PUCSD:~$pg_ctl start -D /usr/local/pgsql/data
also becoz our data dir say "/usr/local/pgsql/data/ has owner postgresql therefore we couldn't access /usr/local/pgsql/data/postmaster.pid which is required for server starting 
also becoz our data dir say "/usr/local/pgsql/data/ has owner postgresql therefore we couldn't access /usr/local/pgsql/data/postmaster.pid which is required for server starting 
then login into another user run the 'source ~/.zshrc' file to invoke pgsql and then the psql can get started by login user

[12] configure the postmaster to automatically stop on system shutdown
save the data dirctory path of postgresql to .bashrc of postgresql user every time service start it get invoked

[13] run multiple Postgers server
- create data directory '/usr/local/pgsql/data' and get it in work by run initdb refering to that directoy then start by the same directory as 
postgres/supriya@PUCSD:~ pg_ctl -D /usr/local/pgsql/data -l logfile start
- create data directory '/home/supriya/spc/data' and get it in work by run initdb refering to that directoy then start by the same directory as 
postgres/supriya@PUCSD:~/usr/local/pgsql/bin/pg_ctl -D /home/supriya/spc/data/ -l logfile start
we can get 2 differnt servers bt can intitailse one at time
